# Euler Problem 6:
# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
#       1^2+2^2+3^2+...+10^2 = 385
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
#       (1+2+3+...+10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
# numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
# natural numbers and the square of the sum.
